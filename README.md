## Pyinnyar Subuu - Inclusive Education for Visual and Hearing Impaired Children

### Project Description

Pyinnyar Subuu is a web platform dedicated to providing inclusive education for visually and hearing impaired children. Our mission is to ensure that these children have equal access to quality education and learning resources, just like their peers.

#### Project Highlights:

- **Inclusive Education:** We believe that every child, regardless of their abilities, deserves the right to a quality education.

- **Voice Guidance for Accessibility:** We've implemented a voice guidance feature that assists visually and hearing impaired users in navigating the website. When users access the website, voice instructions guide them to press specific keys to navigate to different sections. For example, "Press 0 to go to the home page or press 1 to access other resources."

- **Support for Visual and Hearing Impairments:** Our platform offers specialized resources and tools tailored to the unique needs of visually and hearing impaired students.

- **Empowering Learning:** Pyinnyar Subuu empowers these children to pursue education with confidence, opening doors to a brighter future.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our user-friendly web application makes navigation and access to resources easy and intuitive.
