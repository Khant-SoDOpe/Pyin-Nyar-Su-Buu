			<p class="text-center mt-5">Hearing loss is one of the most<i> common chronic health issues</i> in the United States. It decreases your ability to understand speech and hear sounds around you. People who work in noisy environments such as construction sites, road crews, and factories may lose hearing over time from being exposed to constant noise without proper protection.

			However, individuals who listen to loud music with headphones frequently attend open-air music festivals or go to nightclubs can also be affected. The key to preventing hearing loss is to know what is considered “loud” and limiting your exposure. The louder the volume, the less time you can listen safely before harming your hearing.</p>

		<div class="container mb-5">
			<h1>Damage to the Nerves in the Ear</h1>
			<p class="text-center mt-5">The acoustic nerve, also called the auditory nerve, transfers sound information from the inner ear to the brain, beginning when sound vibrations hit the eardrum. When working together with the middle and outer ear, they effectively transmit sound. Minor damage might not show up at a hearing test, but you may notice that it is increasingly difficult to hear and understand the person next to you in a noisy restaurant or crowd.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container mb-5">
			<h1>Exposure to Too Much Noise</h1>
			<p class="text-center mt-5">Over time, being bombarded with loud noises can result in hearing damage. However, it can also happen if you are near sudden short, explosive bursts of noise, such as fireworks or gunshots. The best way to avoid hearing loss is to stay away from loud noises as much as possible.</p>
