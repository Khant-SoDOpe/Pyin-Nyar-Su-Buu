Science  of  research  is  a  set  of  principles  and  methods  for  scientific  investigation  into technology of research, engineering of research and management of research to improve research and research decision making. This article looks at the fundamentals of Science of research and presents a set of scientific principles and methods though answering the questions such as What is research? How can  do  research?  How  can  manage  research?  How  can  automate  a research?  How  can  engineer  a research? And etc. This article also explores  technology of research, engineering of research,  system of research and management of research as a part of science of research. The approaches in science of research will benefit all aspects of science, engineering, technology, system and management. </br></br>
